# Vehicle Rentals

The activity wants us to make a java program that makes a class Vehicle and give it these:

Attributes: 
    String registrationNumber:
    String brand:
    double rentalRatePerDay:

Methods
    double calculateRentalCost(int days)
    void displayInfo() - to print basic vehicle details

I have been able to make the code work with a few test runs but as stated earlier, it wont compile in java (Which is our prof's way of knowing it works.)
